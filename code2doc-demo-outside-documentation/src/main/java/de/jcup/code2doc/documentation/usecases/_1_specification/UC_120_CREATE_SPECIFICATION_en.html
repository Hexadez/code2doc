This is the outside approach to define a specification.
<p> </p>
This is done via an empty specification created by code2doc factory. 
Via a java based DSL like syntax the developer is able to add element definitions and also to define technical inforamation details.
<p>
<i>Every part not being added to the specification will be missed in generated documentation! 
So do not forget anything...</i>
</p>
<p>This is <b>NOT</b> the preferred way to use code2doc!<p><p>You will loose the most automatism parts
and the possibility to use IDE references to scan for annotation links, because  this approach as no annoatations!</p>
<p>The main purpose for using this kind of way to define code2doc-documentation itself was to have no UseCases or any other element inside of 
delivered code2doc-librariries. So a type hierarchy search in IDE does not show use cases you do not expect in your project...</p>
